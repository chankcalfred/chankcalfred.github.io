Hello, I am <b>Kin-Chung Chan (Alfred)</b>, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a>. My research interests include <b>neural spatial computing</b>, <b>neural rendering (NeRF, 3DGS)</b>, <b>head avatars</b>, <b>optical flow estimation</b>, and <b>simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)</b>.

I am actively seeking research collaborations and future opportunities in academia and industry related to neural spatial computing, neural rendering, and 3D computer vision.

You can find my <a href="cv/alfred_chan_cv_20251124.pdf"><b>CV</b></a> here. If you are interested in my work or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me at
